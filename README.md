# Personal website 
My personal website to showcase my programming related projects.

## Description: 
A website that I made using HTML and CSS. The content is about both personal projects and school-related projects related to computer science.

## Why this project exists: 
Even though I am not a front-end web designer, I wanted to make my own website to be able to share my computer science projects and practice writing basic HTML and CSS. 

## Additional modifications or features I plan to make: 
* I will make my website mobile friendly and more responsive. I plan to do it using the bootsrap framework.   
* I will change the contact me page to include a contact form instead of only displaying an email address. 

## How to run it: 
You can see the website live at www.joelaguiar.com
