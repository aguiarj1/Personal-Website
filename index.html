            <p>Thank you for visiting my site! Whether you are a fellow web developer or a tech recruiter, feel free to check out some ofthe projects that I have been working on. Although this website is an online portfolio of my work, I also hope that I'm able to use this space as a way to inspire other newbies like myself to create cool code! At the heart of why I want to become a web developer is my love for solving problems and for being creative. My goal is to become a back-end developer and come up withinnovative solutions to interesting problems. If you share some of the same professional goals lets connect!  </p>
