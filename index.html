            <p>Thank you for visiting my site! Feel free to check out some of the projects that I have been working on. Although this website is an online portfolio of my work, I also hope that I'm able to use this space as a way to connect with other computer programmers and perhaps collaborate on fun projects. I write code because I love solving problems and being creative. My goal is to become a back-end developer and come up withinnovative solutions to interesting problems. If you share some of the same professional goals lets connect!  </p>
