                    <p>After studying English Literature at UC Berkeley, I became a Program Manager for a non-profit organization in San Francisco that served low-wage immigrant workers. I quickly realized they had a strong team of organizers, fundraisers, and project managers, but they were missing the opportunity to leverage technology to achieve programmatic and organizational goals. Their website was out-of-date, and the program I managed did not have a database or a website. Unfortunately, like many non-profits, there were no funds budgeted for technology investments. Knowing technology would help improve programs and add new tools to serve the community, I began learning about web development and relational databases. I loved utilizing technology to add value to an organization.</p>
                    <p>After working in programmatic and management roles for nearly 10 years, I decided to pursue formal training in computer programming with the goal of becoming a software engineer. I am currently completing a post-baccalaureate in Computer Science Fundamentals. Beginning fall 2018, I will be starting a Master's degree in Computer Science with a Specialty in Software Engineering at Seattle University.</p>
