                    <p>After studying English Literature in UC Berkeley, in 2008 I started working for a non-profit in San Francisco that served low-wage immigrant workers managing one of their programs. I quickly noticed that they had aweseme organizers, lawyeres, project managers, fundraisers, but they were missing something very immportant, someone who understood how technology could be leveraged to achieve programmatic and organizatinal goals. Their webiste was 10 years out-of-date, still using HTML tables to format their design. The program that I was managing did not have a database or a website. Unfortunatley, like many non-profits, they didn't have the budget to hire someone to do this work, so shortly after starting working there, I went to the public librarly and started learning about basic web development and about relational databases. That is how my love for techonology firt got started. After working for non-profits for about 10 years, I decided to go back to school and study computer programming. I started a Graduate Certificate in Computer Science Fundamentals in 2017, and will be finishing in June 2018. I will be starting my Master's in Copmputers Science in Seattle University Fall 2018.</p>
