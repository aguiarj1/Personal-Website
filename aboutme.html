                    <p>After working in non-profits for about 10 years, I decided to go back to school and study computer programming. Don't get me wrong, I loved working for immigrant and workers' rights (in fact, I still get to do some cool freelance photo and video work with many Seattle non-profits. <a href="http://www.media4movement.com/" target="_blank"> Check out my photo/video site</a>.). I worked along passionate people that I admire, and I was fortunate enough to be mentored by many fierce community leaders in CA's Bay Area. The last four years of working in non-profits I was doing non-profit management--organizational development, grantwriting, and communications. The last year, I was even the Interim Executive Director of a grassroots-community non-profit in Oakland. That is when I decided to make a decision--do I continue working in non-profits, or do I pursue a career in tech?</p><p> My decision, as you might have guessed, is pursue a career in tech. Let me explain. After studying English Literature in UC Berkeley, in 2008 I started working for a non-profit in San Francisco that served low-wage immigrant workers managing one of their programs. I quickly noticed that they had aweseme organizers, lawyeres, project managers, fundraisers, but they were missing something very immportant. Someone who understood how technology could be leveraged to achieve programmatic and organizatinal goals, goals that would help advance their mission. Their webiste was 10 years out-of-date, still using HTML tables to format their design. The program that I was managing did not have a database or a website. Unfortunatley, like many non-profits, they didn't have the budget to hire someone to do this work, so shortly after starting working there, I went to the public librarly and started learning about basic web development and about relational databases. That is how it all started. Ever since, even though I've always had non-tech job positions in non-profits (Program Director, Director of Development and Communications, Interim Executive Director), I've always managed to integrate tech into my work. In January 2006 I started my first quarter towards a computer programming certificatefrom Seattle Central Community College, and I plan to eventually get my Masters in Computer Programming. I'll be finishing up my certificate program in summer 2007, and I'll be lookning for full-time job opportunities in the technology sector.  </p>
